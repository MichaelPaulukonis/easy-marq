# Marquee texts

![Image Title](https://tympanus.net/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marquee_featured.jpg)

## Plans

- Different types of marquees?
  - The original was "just" scrolling w/ no interaction
- make the "title/link" a shortened version of the scrolled text (so all on-screen)
- work on sizing (too big right now?)
