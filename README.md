# Marquee texts

![Image Title](https://tympanus.net/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marquee_featured.jpg)

## Plans

- Different types of marquees?
  - The original was "just" scrolling w/ no interaction
- make the "title/link" a shortened version of the scrolled text (so all on-screen)
- work on sizing (too big right now?)

- look at this [smaller variation](https://codepen.io/michaelpaulukonis/pen/zYKNJvb)
- some more explanation [here](https://reneroth.org/marquees-in-css/)
- [my codepen copy](https://codepen.io/michaelpaulukonis/pen/KKgWaYX)

- something completely different: <https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/index2.html>
